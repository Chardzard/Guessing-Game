; Program Description: Prompt user to guess a value between 1 &			;
;					   50, then print whether too low or high &			;
;					   have them guess again. Repeat until user			;
;					   has guessed correctly or the user has hit		;
;					   the limit of 10 guesses							;

; Function: Main program driver, prompts user for guesses, keeps track  ;

; Return: None															;

; Procedure: Prompt user for first guess, set counter to 10, then loop  ;
;			 through & check whether guess was too low, high or input   ;
;			 was correct. Re-prompt & decrement counters as needed		;
